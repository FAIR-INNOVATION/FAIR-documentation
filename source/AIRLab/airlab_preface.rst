Software Introduction
--------------------------

Thank you very much for using our company's AIRLab Mixed Palletizing Software. Please read this product user manual carefully to ensure that you can use our product correctly and get the best user experience.

With the rapid development of e-commerce and modern manufacturing, logistics and warehousing systems face increasingly complex operational demands and a variety of goods. Traditional palletizing methods often rely on fixed rules and simple algorithms, which are difficult to cope with these changing demands. This software introduces deep reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively learn and optimize palletizing strategies, thereby achieving intelligent online mixed palletizing functions. Unlike traditional offline palletizing, online palletizing systems can process and stack goods immediately upon arrival without prior planning and preprocessing, improving the degree of automation and efficiency in logistics warehousing and production lines.

The design purpose of this software is to provide a user-friendly platform to help enterprises achieve the following goals:

- Improving palletizing efficiency: Optimize through intelligent algorithms to reduce palletizing time and improve operational efficiency.

- Enhancing flexibility: Capable of handling boxes of different sizes and meeting various palletizing needs.

- Improving palletizing quality: Optimize palletizing strategies to ensure the stability and safety of stacking, reducing cargo damage.

- Simplifying operational processes: Provide an intuitive user interface and operation guide, reducing user learning costs and operational difficulties.

- Supporting simulation verification: Validate palletizing strategies through simulation functions before actual operation, reducing trial and error costs in actual operations.
