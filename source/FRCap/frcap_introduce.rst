Introduction
===================

FRCap is a web-based plug-in that can be integrated into the collaborative robot WebApp. FRCap expands robot functions and application scenarios by building a collaborative robot WebApp configuration page or application based on No de.js and Vue3's Element plus, frcap-ui and frcap-api modules.

Essentially, FRCap is a Web application running in the Node.js environment, independent of WebApp, and WebApp provides management and access services. FRCap can interact with the robot controller through the official interface provided, or customers can write custom interface instructions and processing logic according to actual needs for personalized development.
